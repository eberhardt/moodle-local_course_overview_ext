Extended Course Overview
==========================

Extends the block course_overview in that way, that it shows recent changes in subscribed courses.
The behavior is similiar to the block recent_activities.

Also give the users some options regarding the shown items.

Patches
=========

The patches in the directory patches have to be applied in respect to your Moodle version, since these changes alter the core code.
This has the advantage, that most core changes, which doesn't affect the changed lines of the original plugin, will be merged by GIT automatically.
If there is an conflict between the changes of the patch and Moodle updates, use only Moodle updates.
An appropriate patch will be given in future releases.
